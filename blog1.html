                    Instead of starting my day with a sip of coffee, I start it with <b>lingering questions</b> in mind.
                </p> 
                    
                <blockquote>
                    "What should I do for today?" <br>
                    "What should I prioritize?" <br>
                    "How can I do this or that?"
                </blockquote>
                    
                <p>
                    Amidst these <b>mind-boggling thoughts</b> that clouded my brain came my <b>hero</b> who helped me in deciding with ease. Here is how <b>AI tools and software</b> gradually started to become part of my routine.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    As I go through my day, these tools have become my <b>second brain</b>. At first, it was beneficial for me since I tend to overthink a lot. Having this sense of <b>guidance and assurance</b> helped me in navigating through my day. Some instances where I use AI is whenever I get stuck with complex, complicated, and confusing homeworks. I have always sought these tools' assistance. I also tend to rant to these tools when I feel overwhelmed with emotions. In some way, these tools were like <b>mentors, therapists, and even doctors</b>, which I took advantage due to their accessibility.

                    As much as I enjoy and appreciate the benefits of using AI tools, there are times when the line between using them merely as tools and letting it decide for you start to <b class="blur-effect">blur</b>. It is true that at this age and time, AI is unavoidable and there's no choice for us but to embrace it. However, there should always be <b><i>boundaries</i></b>.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Whenever I use AI for assistance, I feel productive and sure of what I'm doing. But, when I use it to <b>make decisions for me</b>, something in me shifts. Sure, decisions feel easier, but it also feels <b>less mine</b>. These tools view our prompts from an objective standpoint and doesn't look at what's beyond. This is not about how AI gives bad advice, it is about how I feel <b>less in-charge</b> when it comes to my judgment. And this is important for our growth. Growth comes with <b>mistakes, uncertainty, and reflection</b>—something no algorithm can replicate.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    In the end, this is still a part of my growth. AI tools are there for me to <b>amplify my thoughts</b>. They are there for me to assist me. But they should never <b>replicate and replace my voice</b>. As we go on with our lives, it is important to know and internalize that our choices and decisions are ours. Now that you're done reading this, my title could use a little tweaking. Changing it to: "A Day in My Life with Me and AI" now emphasizes my position, my stance, and my presence in my daily routine with AI as a <b>mere companion</b>.
